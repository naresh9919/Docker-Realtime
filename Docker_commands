                     CREATE DOCKER IMAGES



-> docker images (for serching existing images)

-> docker info (information of docker)

-> docker search hello-world (for searching new image)

-> docker pull hello-world (to download new image)

-> docker images (for existing images)



                        CREATE DOCKER CONTAINER

-> docker ps (for searching existing containers)

-> docker run -it centos (centos is a container name)
   
   it will create new container and switch to the container automaticaly

-> Exit (it will exit from container and container will stop automatical)

-> docker run -itd centos (it will create new container and it will not switc to the container)

-> docker ps (it will list existing running conatiner)

-> docker ps -a (it will list all existing conatiners)

-> ctrl+p+q (for exit from conatainer without stop)

-> docker exec -it containerID /bin/bash   (to connect conatiners)

-> docker start conatainerID (to start stoped conatainers)

-> docker attach conatainerID (for in to the container)

-> docker stop ( to stop runnig container)

-> docker pa -a (for listing conatainers)

-> docker run -itd centos ( it will create conatiner and it will not swich to the conatiner )

-> docker run -itd ubuntu ( it will create ubuntu image and container also )

   -> docker image
   -> docker ps

-> docker exec -it conatiner ID  (for in to the container )
